# Soccer-Database-Analysis
## Dataset
I selected the soccer database from Kaggle. It contains more than 25,000 matches and more than 10,000 players , players and from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. By means of Exploratory Data Analysis method. Although we wonâ€™t be getting into the details of it for our example, the dataset even has attributes on weekly game updates, team line up, and detailed match events. The goal of this notebook is to walk you through an end to end process of analyzing a dataset . Our simple analytical process will include some steps for exploring and cleaning our dataset.



Questions,we will answer from analysis:

we can predict the the winner of match based on this dataset
we have the history of teams matches and thier players?
can we identify the team or player belong to the best teams/players ?



Finding:
Analyzing the league, country, player, player attributes, team, team atributes nad match tables gave a better understanding of the data. once features are meerged pass it to machine learning algorithm to predict the winner of the future match.
We use player attributes table to groups/cluster the players based on its skills like "passing","long pass" etc,to identify which player belong to this group.
And we can use any table and make our predction on it ,I selected the player attributes to make my own
